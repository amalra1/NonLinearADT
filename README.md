# NON-LINEAR ABSTRACT DATA TYPES  

The main difference between this rep's content and the Linear Abstract Data Types one is that the elements stored in the structures aren't placed linearly. That means that if we want to traverse the whole thing, we can't do it in a single run (Needs to go back some steps in order to traverse everything).
